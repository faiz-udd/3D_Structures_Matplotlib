##Matplotlib Structures

Welcome to the Matplotlib Structures repository! Here you'll find various data visualization structures implemented using Matplotlib library in Python.

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library in Python that allows you to create a wide range of plots and charts. This repository serves as a showcase of different structures that can be created using Matplotlib.

## Structures Included

1. **Line Plots**: Visualize trends over time or continuous variables.
2. **Scatter Plots**: Display individual data points to identify patterns or relationships.
3. **Bar Plots**: Represent categorical data using bars of different heights.
4. **Histograms**: Show the distribution of numerical data using bins.
5. **Pie Charts**: Illustrate the proportion of different categories within a dataset.
6. **3D Plots**: Visualize data in three-dimensional space for complex relationships.

## Usage

Each structure is implemented in a separate Python script within the repository. You can run these scripts individually to generate the corresponding plots.
